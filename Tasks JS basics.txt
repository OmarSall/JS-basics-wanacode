1. Create two variables called width and height. Each of those variables should hold some number. Then, create a new variable that holds the area of a rectangle, calculated based on the width and height variables. Print it to the console.

console.clear();

let width = 7;
let height = 10;

let area = width * height;

console.log("The area of the rectangle is: " + area);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

2. Create two variables called firstNumber and secondNumber. Assign each of them with a different number. Write a program that swaps both values.

console.clear();

let firstNumber = 5;
let secondNumber = 7;

console.log("Before Swap:");
console.log("firstNumber = ", firstNumber, "secondNumber = ", secondNumber);

let temp = firstNumber;
firstNumber = secondNumber;
secondNumber = temp;

console.log("After Swap:");
console.log("firstNumber = ", firstNumber, "secondNumber = ", secondNumber);

-------------------------XOR approach---------------------------------------
console.clear();

let firstNumber = 5;
let secondNumber = 7;

console.log("Before Swap:");
console.log("firstNumber = ", firstNumber, "secondNumber = ", secondNumber);

firstNumber = firstNumber ^ secondNumber;
secondNumber = firstNumber ^ secondNumber;
firstNumber = firstNumber ^ secondNumber;

console.log("After Swap:");
console.log("firstNumber =", firstNumber, "secondNumber =", secondNumber);

3. Create variables that hold grades from three different classes:

Physics

Math

English

Calculate the average of the grades. If the average equals 4 out of 5 or higher, print "Good job!". Otherwise, print "Try harder!"

console.clear();

function average(grades) {
    const sum = grades.reduce((acc, currValue) => acc + currValue.grade, 0);
    
    return sum / grades.length;
}

const grades = [
    {subject: 'physics', grade: 3 },
    {subject: 'math', grade: 5},
    {subject: 'english', grade: 4}
    ];


let avg = average(grades);

console.log("Average grade:", avg.toFixed(2));

if (avg >= 4) {
    console.log("Good job!");
} else {
    console.log("Try harder!");
}

4. Fix the code:

const currentAge = 30;
const retirenmentAgeInPoland = 67;
const yearsLeftToRetirenment = retirenmentAgeInPoland;

yearsLeftToRetirenment = retirenmentAgeInPoland - currentAge;

console.log(yearsLeftToRetirenment);
the expected result of the above code:

37 

---------
const currentAge = 30;
const retirenmentAgeInPoland = 67;
let yearsLeftToRetirenment = retirenmentAgeInPoland;

yearsLeftToRetirenment = retirenmentAgeInPoland - currentAge;

console.log(yearsLeftToRetirenment);

5. Fix the code (3 mistakes):

const isPayingVAT = true;
let VATRateInPoland = 0.23;
const incomeTaxRate = 0.12;
let monthlyIncome = 3500;
const taxToPay = 0;

if (isPayingVAT) {
  taxToPay = monthlyIncome * vatRateInPoland;
}

taxToPay = taxToPay + monthlyIncome * incomeTaxRate;

console.log('tax to pay: ' + taxToPay);

-------

the expected result of the above code:

tax to pay: 1225 
----------------------------

console.clear();

const isPayingVAT = true;
let VATRateInPoland = 0.23;
const incomeTaxRate = 0.12;
let monthlyIncome = 3500;
let taxToPay = 0;  //First mistake

if (isPayingVAT) {
  taxToPay = monthlyIncome * VATRateInPoland; //second mistake
}

taxToPay += monthlyIncome * incomeTaxRate;  //third mistake (not critical one)

console.log('tax to pay: ' + taxToPay);

6. Declare a variable called isSunny and assign a boolean value to it. Create an if-else statement that checks if it's sunny. If it is, print "Don't forget your sunglasses!". If it's not, print "You might need an umbrella."

console.clear();

let isSunny = false;

if (isSunny) {
    console.log("Don't forget your sunglasses!");
} else {
    console.log("You might need an umbrella.");
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

7. Create a variable named currentMonth and assign a number representing the current month. Use an if statement to check the month and print a message based on the season (e.g., "It's winter" for December, January, and February).

console.clear();
let currentMonth = 3; 

if (currentMonth === 12 || currentMonth === 1 || currentMonth === 2) {
    console.log("It's winter.");
} else if (currentMonth >= 3 && currentMonth <= 5) {
    console.log("It's spring.");
} else if (currentMonth >= 6 && currentMonth <= 8) {
    console.log("It's summer.");
} else if (currentMonth >= 9 && currentMonth <= 11) {
    console.log("It's autumn.");
} else {
    console.log("Invalid month.");
}

8. Create two variables personWeight and personHeight  and assign some numbers there. Calculate the BMI (and store it in well-named variable) using the formula BMI = weight / (height * height) . Print the calculated BMI.

console.clear();
let personWeight = 70; //Weight in kilograms
let personHeight = 1.75; // height in meters

// Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height)
let bodyMassIndex = personWeight / (Math.pow(personHeight, 2));

console.log("Calculated BMI:", bodyMassIndex.toFixed(2)); 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

9. Write a program that checks if a person is eligible to vote. Declare a variable called age and assign it a numeric value. Use an if-else statement to determine if the person can vote (age >= 18) and print (using console.log() ) the result:

a citizen can vote  if the age is at least 18

a citizen can't vote if the age is less than 18

console.clear();
let age = 17;

if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("A citizen can vote.");
} else {
    console.log("A citizen can't vote.");
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

10. Write a code that simulates a traffic light. Declare a variable called currentColor with values "red", "yellow", or "green". Use an if statement to print a message based on the current color (e.g., "Stop" for red, "Speed up" for yellow, "Go" for green).

console.clear();
let currentColor = "red";

if (currentColor === "red") {
    console.log("Stop");
} else if (currentColor === "yellow") {
    console.log("Speed up");
} else if (currentColor === "green") {
    console.log("Go");
} else {
    console.log("Invalid color");
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

11. Declare a variable called month with the number of the month. Use an if statement to print the month's name.

console.clear();
let month = 5; 

if (month === 1) {
    console.log("January");
} else if (month === 2) {
    console.log("February");
} else if (month === 3) {
    console.log("March");
} else if (month === 4) {
    console.log("April");
} else if (month === 5) {
    console.log("May");
} else if (month === 6) {
    console.log("June");
} else if (month === 7) {
    console.log("July");
} else if (month === 8) {
    console.log("August");
} else if (month === 9) {
    console.log("September");
} else if (month === 10) {
    console.log("October");
} else if (month === 11) {
    console.log("November");
} else if (month === 12) {
    console.log("December");
} else {
    console.log("Invalid month number");
}

12. Declare a variable and assign a number to it. Print "Divisible by 3" if the variable is divisible by 3. Print "Divisible by 5" if the variable is divisible by 5. Print "Divisible by 3 and 5" if the variable is divisible both by 3 and by 5.

console.clear();
let number = 9; // Change this value to test different cases

// Check divisibility conditions
if (number % 3 === 0 && number % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Divisible by 3 and 5");
} else if (number % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Divisible by 3");
} else if (number % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Divisible by 5");
} else {
    console.log("Not divisible by 3 or 5");
}

13. Create a variable named radius and assign a number to it. Create a variable named circleArea that stores the area of the circle using the formula area = Ï€ * radius^2. Use MDN to find out how to use the PI number in JS.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/PI

console.clear();
let radius = 3;
let circleArea = Math.PI * Math.pow(radius, 2);

console.log("Circle Area:", circleArea.toFixed(2));

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

14. Create a variable studentScore  and assign a number representing a student's score (0-100). Use an if-else statement to determine the grade (A, B, C, D, F) based on the score and print the grade. For instance, a score greater than or equal to 90 could be an 'A', 80-89 could be a 'B', and so on.

console.clear();
let studentScore = 55;
let grade;

if (studentScore >= 90) {
    grade = "A";
} else if (studentScore >= 80) {
    grade = "B";
} else if (studentScore >= 70) {
    grade = "C";
} else if (studentScore >= 60) {
    grade = "D";
} else {
    grade = "F";
}

console.log("Student Grade:", grade);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

15. Declare a variable representing a car's speed and assign a number to it. Declare another variable representing a speed limit and assign a number to it. Use an if-else statement to print "Speed is fine" if the car's speed is less than or equal to the speed limit, or "Speeding!" if it's over the limit.


console.clear();
let carSpeed = 62;

let speedLimit = 50;

if (carSpeed <= speedLimit) {
    console.log("Speed is fine");
} else {
    console.log("Speeding!");
}

16. Delete the else statement and adjust the code to make sure that the output is the same as before.

remember that you can give a default value to a variable when declaring it

const age = 21;
let isAdult;

if(age >= 18) {
  isAdult = true;
} else {
  isAdult = false;
}

alert(isAdult)

--------------

console.clear();

const age = 21;
let isAdult = false;  // if we set isAdult initially as false then we don't need else statement

if(age >= 18) {
  isAdult = true;
}

alert(isAdult)


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

17. Extend the code so it prints if the user can drive or not. 

To determine it, you need to check if the user is an adult and has a driving license. Assign true to the isAdult variable if the user has at least 18 years and false  if the opposite.

Assign true  to canDriveLegally if the user can drive legally or false if not.

Make sure to print (alert() or console.log() ) the value of the canDriveLegally variable in human-readable form.

const age = 21;
const hasDrivingLicense = true;
let isAdult, canDriveLegally;

-------------------------

console.clear();
const age = 21;
const hasDrivingLicense = true;

let isAdult = age >= 18; // true if age is 18 or older

let canDriveLegally = isAdult && hasDrivingLicense;

if (canDriveLegally) {
    console.log("You can drive legally");
} else {
    console.log("You cannot drive legally");
}
